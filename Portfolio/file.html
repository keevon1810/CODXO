            <p>I’m Keevon Lyle Jacobs, a second-year computer science student with a strong passion for problem-solving and software development. Throughout my journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience, whether it’s through personal projects or collaborative efforts in hackathons like the Adapt IT Hackathon, where I worked with a diverse team to tackle real-world challenges. My technical skills include proficiency in languages like Java, where I developed a Snake game agent capable of interpreting game states and handling movement logic. I’m currently working on an eCommerce app, where I’m implementing backend routes for key features such as product listings, carts, and checkout processes. My drive for learning and growth is fueled by my desire to continuously improve and contribute to impactful projects.</p>
